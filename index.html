                <p>I have no idea what kind of videos they are categorized as lmfao.</p>
                <p>These parody videos I made and uploaded to youtube incorporates heavy amounts of video compositing, vfx, and a dash of animation.</p>
                <p>I upload videos in probably the slowest frequency you'll ever see on youtube, mainly because of these reasons:

                <p>Most of the software I personally develop are to solve my own specific problems. Here's a quick overview on some of the software
                    I spent most time and effort on:
                <ol type="1">
                    <li><strong>FortressBot</strong><br/>
                        A moderation-oriented discord bot made to automatically delete server invites advertisements and washing non-ascii usernames/nicknames.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>StatusBot</strong><br/>
                        A discord bot made to ping me if a certain bot goes offline.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>TridentFrame</strong><br/>
                        A small python program made to combine image sequences into GIFs or APNGs, and vice-versa.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Rhombus</strong><br/></li>
                    Yet another discord bot, but with OCR (Optical Character Recognition) capabilities.
                </ol>
