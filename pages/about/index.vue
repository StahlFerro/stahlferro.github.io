                <p>Hello! I am StahlFerro - I am both a youtube VFX Composite-Animations content creator and a software developer</p>
                <p><strong>&gt; VFX Composite-Animations</strong><br/>
                    Ranging from the crudely-made Montage Parody-style videos, to cinematic animation and VFX composites, I create a very wide range
                    of unique entertainment videos that can be considered it's own category. I play around with a lot of VFX and composition of
                    static images, both combined to produce a hybrid form of animation that displays an intense visual graphic experience. Most of my
                    main works are uploaded as videos on youtube, but I also make short GIFs and animations posted on my Imgur account
                </p>
                <p><strong>&gt; Software Developer</strong><br/>
                    I'm the sole developer of the Discord moderation bot FortressBot, a bot made with auto-moderative features.
                    Aside from FortressBot, I also develop StatusBot, a little discord bot to notify me if some bots I monitor goes offline.
                    I'm working on projects and tools that help me with my works, and I host them on Github so other people can find
                    use of it
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Although videos require weeks to months to work on, and infrequent youtube uploads make me appear very inactive,
                    I am most active on my Discord server, where I centralize both FortressBot's development and my youtube community inside it.
                    I monitor the server everyday regardless of its current activity.<br/>
