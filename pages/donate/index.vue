                        <p>Hello there. I would like to highlight my current situation regarding to why I am opening a donation</p>
                        <p>I am currently working as a software engineer. However, the pay is not enought to cover our financial stress, mainly for both me and my younger 
                            sibling's university fees.
                        </p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, a lot of the available postings on my island offer roughly the same low wages, most even lower. A few even dare to 'trap' 
                            desperate students on a 1 year contract that pays 1/3 of the minimum wage. Adding more to that, unemployment has risen drastically since late 2018, 
                            and searching up till now, no well-paying software job postings are on sight.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In one of my focused attempts to end our decade-long financial issues and overcome the nationwide economic disparity, I decided that it might be 
                            viable to turn what I am the most passionate on, into someday, a proper job. Making VFX-animation videos and developing software that are free and 
                            open source, in hopes to provide both entertainment  and technical solutions to everyone without charge. I know how enormously time-and-effort-consuming 
                            it is to make or maintain just only one between those two and how much I don't care wasting all of my sleep time to put more work on both of them, 
                            all the bills still have to be paid. There's not a lot of golden opportunities in my local environment. So, through this international window,
                            I kindly ask, for your support.
                        </p>
